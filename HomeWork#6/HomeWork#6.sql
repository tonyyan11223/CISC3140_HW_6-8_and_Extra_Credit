I learned that facial recognition can be used for so many things nowadays such as unlocking electric appliances, being able to take the elevator and being able to unlock a car. ','The presenter had a video of voiceprint recognition which was really cool and he had different examples of AI in vehicles. I like how each slide he had a video to show us visually an example of AI in cars. The presenter was very detailed in describing each AI example in cars.','The presenter could try to speak more loudly and instead of letting the video automatically play as soon as the slide is switched he could just put a link and link to it instead so it won''t interrupt him when he is trying to speak about the topic.

The videos were cool and modeled what actual cars with AI behave like, ie: voice recognition and face recognition that are connected to the car''s controls. Stops if feeling tired or distracted.
